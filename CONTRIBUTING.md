## Contributing Guidelines

1. Add a new folder in ReadMe with your name.
2. Inside the folder make sure to include 3 files:
  - `config.json` : Take a look at other to get a idea of valid syntax.
  - `youname.png` : A screenshot of how the readme looks once rendered.
  - `yourname.md` : The markdown you used to create that view. Will be available to users in the website(coming soon)
3. Make sure your PR does not close the issue.
4. Make sure the json in `config.json` is valid.

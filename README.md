# ReadMePros
A collection of awesome readme files for github profiles. We are curently working on a website that will show these read me files in a nice way with options to filter, read source code, and with a link to take users directly to the github profile of the contributor.

# How to Contribute
1. Create a pull request that adds a folder with these files:
  - config.json
  - <your-name>.png
  - <your-name>.md
  
Make sure you replace <your-name> with lowercase, concatination of your first name and last name.
